Grandfather was one of the first radio enthusiasts.
Already at 13 years old he was constructing radio receivers,
as can be seen in this photograph from December 2nd, 1927.

<!-- And then in my childhood grandfather gave me a radio construction kit â€”
where could also assemble a radio receiver, but much simpler. -->

And the next photograph was taken in adulthood,
and the radio equipment is already more substantial.
