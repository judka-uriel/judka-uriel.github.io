At 19 years old, grandfather enrolled in the Kharkiv Automobile and Highway Institute (KhADI).
The photograph was taken by great-grandfather in Kharkiv on May 2nd, 1933.
The leaves on the trees had not yet bloomed, so you can see
that this was the first sunny, summer-warm day that year.
It's also interesting that instead of cars there were still horse-drawn carriages.
