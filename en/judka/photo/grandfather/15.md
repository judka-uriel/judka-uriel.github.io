In this photograph, taken at
[Sosnovka](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Соснівка_(Черкаси))
on September 12, 1929, grandfather is 15 years old.
The photograph was taken by great-grandfather — there are
many photographs of this place online with his photo studio logo.

And when I finished first grade with all A's on my report card,
my grandfather presented me my first bicycle as a reward.

And so in the morning we loaded the bicycle into the car and drove to our summerhouse.
We went to the forest edge with the bicycle, and grandfather taught me to
ride it — about 50 years after this photograph was taken.
