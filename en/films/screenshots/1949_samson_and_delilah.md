What's the mistake?

Samson was a nazirite, so he could not drink wine.

Whereas in Shoftim 16:17-19 everything is correct: "He said to her,
â€œNo razor has ever touched my head, for I have been a nazirite ...
And she lulled him to sleep on her lap."  But it doesn't say
that she put sleeping powder in the wine.

Actually, this misconception is widespread.  For example, in the song
[Samson and Delilah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_and_Delilah_(Middle_of_the_Road_song))
there are such lyrics: "then he started sleeping
'cos she slipped something in the wine".
