What's the mistake?

<details><summary>Show answer</summary>
<p>Samson was a nazirite, so he could not drink wine.</p>
<p>Whereas in Shoftim 16:17-19 everything is correct: "He said to her,
â€œNo razor has ever touched my head, for I have been a nazirite ...
And she lulled him to sleep on her lap."  But it doesn't say
that she put sleeping powder in the wine.</p>
